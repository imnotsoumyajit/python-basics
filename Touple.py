# Similar to list , we can store items but we cant modify them 
# Cant add new items, remove them , etc
# ie , They are immutable
# nums=(1,2,3,4,5)
# nums.count()#to see no of occ of an item
# nums.index()#to see the first occ of an item
# print(nums[0])
# try to store the values of the touple in variables, it makes everything clean
coordinates=(1,2,3)
# we can 
# x=coordinates[0]
# y=coordinates[1]
# z=coordinates[2]
# or you can just do :
x,y,z=coordinates
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
